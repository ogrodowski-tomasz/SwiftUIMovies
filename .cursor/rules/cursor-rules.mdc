alwaysApply: true
Design pattern: MV (Model-View)
Rely on native SwiftUI's property wrappers: State, Environment, Query etc
Use Observation framework
Inject mock services to Previews 
For every new network endpoint add empty static json file and use this file in Mock service
For all networking operations use Swift Concurrency framework
For every screen which relies on data from server, have proper error handling using native alert view component
